    <p>There is evidence that frogs have roamed the Earth for more than 200 million years, at least as long as the dinosaurs.While the life spans of frogs in the wild are unknown, frogs in captivity have been known to live more than 20 years.
     There are over 6,000 species of frogs worldwide. Scientists continue to search for new ones.</p>
